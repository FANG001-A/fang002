## Introduction

This repository contains the complementary material for 项目实践 in 2020 spring.
Due to the distributed and
asynchronous
nature of this study format, we will steer the course through a series of self-contained units around programming, visualization, and simulation, which may be your interest for your future endeavor or not. This course tries to fulfill this arrangement by introducing some tools and demonstrating their capacity. 
This unit is about introduction to software engineering.

Please go through the video and slides first and then get familiar with git.

### Exercise

1. Create account on Github/Gitlab.
2. Use the Git command learned to grab content from https://github.com/pipehappy1/SES2020spring to your repository on Github/Gitlab.
3. Comment on the issue https://github.com/pipehappy1/SES2020spring/issues/1 with the link to your repository.

### Reference

4 units are planned for the first 4 weeks. Each unit will contain at least 2 parts. The 1st part will discuss general practice and methodology around software engineering and this serves as the general topic across the board. The second part will introduce some tools or library and show how to use them. It’s highly recommended that you should do your research about this tool or library before the classroom and practice with it after the class. The classroom time will be question/answer time and I will stay online to answer your question through Github issues, QQ, and Wechat.
